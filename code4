### 4. **Create a Changelog**
You can maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` file to document all changes for each release. This helps users understand the evolution of your project.

#### Example CHANGELOG.md:
```markdown
# Changelog

## [Csaloon] - YYYY-MM-DD
### Added
- Initial setup with `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md`.

### Notes
- This is the first release with foundational files.
